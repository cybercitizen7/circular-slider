# Circular Slider

Coding Challenge for Celtra. Circular Slider is a reusable slider written in
pure JavaScript. It supports several configuration options such as:

- Slider Color
- Max / Min value
- Step
- Radius
- Container

# Running the Code

I recommend using VS Code's
[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
extension (credits to Riwick Dey). When you open the project in VS Code, with
the extension installed, simply press **Go Live** in your bottom-right corner.

# Using the App

App offers you to draw circular sliders by either pressing the `Generate Random`
or `Create New Slider` buttons.

`Create New Slider` will prompt you for inputs on:

- Minimum / Starting Value
- Maximum Value
- Step Value
- The name of the Slider
- Enable SmoothScroll

Enabling **smooth scrolling** will allow you to drag the slider however you
want, without necessary affecting the value changes. If it is set to `false`,
the slider will Snap-in-Place on each Step Value.

`Generate Random` will generate maximum amount of sliders with random options.
