# Circular Slider
Coding Challenge for Celtra. Circular Slider is a reusable slider written in pure JavaScript. 
It supports several configuration options such as:
- Slider Color
- Max / Min value
- Step
- Radius
- Container

# Running the Code
I recommend using VS Code's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension (credits to Riwick Dey).
When you open the project in VS Code, with the extension installed, simply press **Go Live** in your bottom-right corner.
